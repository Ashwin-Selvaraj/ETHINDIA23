# C FUND - Crowdfunding Network

## Overview

Web2 crowdfunding platforms often face significant challenges in real-world scenarios. Issues such as high fees, limited accessibility, centralized control, lack of transparency, payment processing problems, fraud, mismanagement, long settlement times, and overreliance on intermediaries contribute to trust issues among funders and project owners.

Our mission at C FUND is to address these challenges and redefine the crowdfunding experience. With our motto "With Trust Fund (WTF)," we aim to break away from intermediaries, reduce platform costs, enhance transparency, and maintain user privacy.

## Key Features

- **Transparency:** We prioritize transparency, ensuring that all transactions and project details are visible on the blockchain, fostering trust among users.

- **Decentralization:** C FUND eliminates centralized control, providing a more democratic and inclusive crowdfunding environment.

- **Privacy:** While ensuring transparency, we also prioritize user privacy, creating a balance between openness and confidentiality.
